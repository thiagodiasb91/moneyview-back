* **REST API** and **CRUD** endpoints with using **AWS Lambda, API Gateway**
* **Data persistence** with using **AWS DynamoDB**
* **Decouple microservices** with events using **Amazon EventBridge**
* **Message Queues** for cross-service communication using **AWS SQS**
* **Cloud stack development** with **IaC** using **AWS CloudFormation and AWS CDK**

## Prerequisites
You will need the following tools:

* AWS Account and User
* AWS CLI
* NodeJS
* AWS CDK Toolkit
* Docker

### Run The Project
